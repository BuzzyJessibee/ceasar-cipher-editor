# Lyra's Caesar Cipher Editor
A small little notepad-like program that has buttons to cipher and decipher your text using a Ceasar Cipher.

# Overview
I've been writing a lot, and sometimes I wish I could leave my work open but not let anyone see it. Probably not the most practical solution but it was fun to implement and that's what's important to me.

I wanted to write it in Java because JSwing looked interesting to me, and I was honestly surprised how easy it was to implement what I wanted in a short period of time!
